# Privacy Policy

**Video Compression Analyzer** is a Chrome extension that analyzes video playback data from YouTube to estimate compression quality.

## What Data We Collect

This extension does **not** collect, store, or transmit any personal or user-identifiable data.

## How It Works

The extension runs entirely in your browser. It accesses information from the currently active YouTube tab — such as video resolution, playback stats, and bitrate — to estimate compression efficiency. No data is sent to any server or third party.

## Permissions

- **activeTab**: Allows access to the currently active YouTube tab when the extension popup is opened.
- **scripting**: Enables injecting scripts into the YouTube page to measure video playback statistics.
- **host_permissions**: Limited to `youtube.com` to allow functionality only on YouTube video pages.

## Data Usage

All processing is done locally. The extension does not track users, store browsing history, or display ads.
